This project uses **Dependabot** to keep dependencies up to date:

- Weekly updates for NuGet packages  
- Monthly check for the .NET SDK  
- Pull requests created automatically after passing CI  
- Just tag `@dependabot rebase` or `@dependabot merge` to manage updates

### CI/CD 

Builds project, Runs automatic tests, both unit and integration tests.  Make sure we need to confirm PRs, have others look at them, etc. 

## Inspirations

Here are some links and articles for best practices, and examples, including my own git repo from a small project I've made.

## About
This is a relatively simple demonstration application which should be enough to showcase theoretically a real world scenario.  
I've used some inspirations both from my past experience working with something similar, and some personal projects I've worked on. 
For preparation I have used Articles, videos and sparring with chatgpt, regarding some of the design decisions, pros and cons of some architectures, etc.

The app simply receives a post request and a get request, I picked minimal API because I believed it would make sense in a smaller more contained project, since then
I might have some reservations, mostly just because the functionality for data annotations seems to be missing, not a big deal for this project, but it's something to keep in mind
