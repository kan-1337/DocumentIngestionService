## About
This is a relatively simple demonstration application which should be enough to showcase theoretically a real world scenario.  
I've used some inspirations both from my past experience working with something similar, and some personal projects I've worked on. 
For preparation I have used Articles, videos and sparring with chatgpt, regarding some of the design decisions, pros and cons of some architectures, etc.

The app simply receives a post request and a get request, I picked minimal API because I believed it would make sense in a smaller more contained project, since then
I might have some reservations, mostly just because the functionality for data annotations seems to be missing, not a big deal for this project, but it's something to keep in mind
